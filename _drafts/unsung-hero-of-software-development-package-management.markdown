title: 'Unsung hero of software development: Package management'
---

 - Software development has become easier
 - Because of great programming languages
 - But also because it is much easier to share code now
   - And to do version dependency
 
 
### Assembly
 
 - Copy pasta code
 - Some linking (?)
 - Inconsistent instruction sets. :D
  
### C

 - Header files / binaries
 - No inbuilt versioning, done using external package managers (`apt`, `yum`, etc.)
 - Hard to get packages NOT included in repositories
 
### Java

 - Jar files in `CLASSPATH`
 - Ger binaries yourself
 
### Python
 - `easy_install`
 - `pip`
 
 If you have been out of the loop for a while (as I had been), then here's a neat fact you may have missed: `--require-virtualenv` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 
### Perl
 - `cran`
 
### Ruby
 - `gems`

### Node
 - `npm`

### Nim
 - `nimble`
 
### R
 - `install.package` (from inside the REPL!)
 
### Julia
 - `Pkg.install` (from inside the REPL)
 
### Swift/ObjC
 - `pods`
 
### Meteor (!?!!)
 - Well.
