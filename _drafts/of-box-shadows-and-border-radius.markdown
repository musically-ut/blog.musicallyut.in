layout: post
title: Of box-shadows and border-radius

I stole Google Hangout's styling for Chanslate, thanks to [detailed instructions on how to do it](http://css-tricks.com/replicating-google-hangouts-chat/).

I liked the layout and the users commented that it is hard to beat white on black and alternating _avatars_ when it comes to making chat accessible. However, there was one minor issue which Chris does not take care of in the shadows on the arrows on the avatars well.
