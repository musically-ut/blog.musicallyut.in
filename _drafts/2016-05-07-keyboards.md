I have used a variety of keyboards over my lifetime and this is a short
description of what I have felt like using each of them. They are roughly arranged in order of my liking for them.

## Noppoo Nano 75S (w/ Noppoo Brown)

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ADpnl3AVL._SX425_.jpg" class="limit-size" />)](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00V6PQ62O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Feel:

 - Programmable!
 - Got it on an Amazon Warehouse deal
 - Noppoo brown keys are perfect and close to Cherry browns
 - Can control mouse (seldom used feature)
 - Separate Fn row allows a key for tilde and backtick.

Customization:

 - Fn + {F1, F2, F3, F5, F6, F7} for Mute, Volume -, Volume +, Prev, Play/Pause, Next media buttons
 - Mouse control using Fn + UHJK, 

Peeves:

 - Trouble in connecting/disconnecting
 - Spacebar key broke: connecting it upside down helps
 - Uses lightening cable for connection, but not a standard Apple one?
 - Customization requires special software which runs only on Windows
 - Software/Manual only in Chinese


## Pok3r Cherry Red MX

Feel:

 - Programmable!
 - Liner keys feel a bit mushy
 - Easiest of the bunch to carry
 - Uses the standard connector with Mini USB port

Customizations:

 - Ctrl as Cmd key
 - Fn + WASD as the arrow keys along with IJKL
 - Fn + ZXCVB for Mute, Volume -, Volume +, Play/Pause and Next (after firmware upgrade)
 - Have switched the Fn and Alt key (Using Dip switches)

Peeves:

 - Keep hitting Fn + Spacebar all the time
 - Typing tilde (~) and backtick is not easy to get used to.
 - Using Shift key for selection requires some practise.

## Race II

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PzsbQVpCL.jpg" class="limit-size" />](https://www.amazon.de/KBTalking-Mx-Blue-International-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B0088054TG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1464819123&sr=8-3&keywords=race+2+keyboard)


Feel:

 - Programmable, but Fn key is placed at a strange place.
 - Has real arrow keys.
 - Has backlight.

Customization:

 - Fn + WASD for arrow kwys (in addition to normal ones).

Peeves:

 [<img src="http://www.pckeyboard.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/UB40PGA-LG_2_800x304.jpg" class="limit-size" />](http://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/UB40PGA)

## Kinesis

[![Kinesis](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HqsVDtDuL._SX425_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-KB500USB-BLK-Advantage-Contoured-Keyboard/dp/B000LVJ9W8?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)

It is ergonomic and the wrist rests make it more comfortable. I find the keys
to be close to Cherry Browns, and relatively easy to reach. The arrow keys are
not placed at the usual place, the brackets too are at a different location,
and so are the equals sign and back-tick. It takes some getting used to. It took
me ~ 3 weeks before I was back at my original typing speed with it.

However, my right hand's thumb still hurt after using it for a while. Hence,
I moved the space/enter key to the same side of the keyboard using the internal
programming. This made the typing a bit more comfortable for me, but a lot
harder on my left hand. I also had to switch the Ctrl/Cmd key to be able to
reach the Cmd (I uses Caps lock as my go-to Ctrl key).

Feel:

 - Programmable!

Customization:

 - Ctrl as Cmd key
 - Ctrl/Cmd switched 
 - Cherry Brown like keys.

Peeves:

 - German layout
 - Hurts wrists anyway
 - Unweildy

Feel:

 - Wireless!
 - Chicklets keyboard, surprisingly springy and satisfying
 - Excellent to use with tablets/phones

Customization:
