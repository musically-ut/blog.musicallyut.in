## What do scientists do

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Elements_of_the_scientific_method):

> Four essential elements of the scientific method are iterations, recursions, interleavings, or orderings of the following:
> 
>  1. Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry)
>  2. Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject)
>  3. Predictions (reasoning including logical deduction from the hypothesis or theory)
>  4. Experiments (tests of all of the above)

Scientists do this about reality.

## What is debugging

From my personal experience and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging#Typical_debugging_process), while debugging your own program:

 1. Reproduce the problem (_observe_ it)
 2. Distill the minimal input (_hypothesize_ and eliminate extragenous factors)
 3. Track down the origin (_predict_ results of the fix)
 4. Test to see if the fix works (_experiment_)

Program is like a _complete universe_. That universe becomes _unknown_ if it is someone else's code.

This is _exactly_ what scientists are up to!

## Programmers and scientists

I have met programmers, like [lemmih](https://plus.google.com/+DavidHimmelstrup/posts), who can just _guess_ how a program works by thinking how he would have designed it. And, gosh, is he usually right.

I wonder if that is how good scientists do it.
