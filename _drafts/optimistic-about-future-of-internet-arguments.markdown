# Arguments on the Internet

It is usually a foregone conclusion that arguments on the Internet head nowhere and only make matters worse.

There is no dearth of evidence of this fact:

 - [This Video will make you angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc)

 - [Echo chambers](www.invalid)

Recently, in [WSDM 2017](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2017/), one of the honourable mentions was [a paper](https://gvrkiran.github.io/balancingViews/) which proposed a way of bringing the warring groups a little together.

Despite this, I still am optimistic about the future.

# Light at the end of the tunnel

My hypothesis is based on an observation which is surprising enough to have an [xkcd comics](www.invalid) dedicated to it.

The key idea is that more exposure to English language, even if it is not perfect, is going to make a difference for the people using English at the "pro" level (i.e., in this case the students writing the standardized exams).

The same way, I expect that as people become more aware and start to have an opinion rather than living in a small community where they do not even have to think about certain issues, the better the "pro" opinion-havers of the generations (read: the politicians) will become.

Perhaps Moneyball-ing the elections is an indication of that, but we are still in the nascent stages of this happening.

## Caveat


The danger, of course, is that we may not start improving quickly enough: perhaps the "short-term" escalation would be sufficient to put us beyond the threshold where we end up in a "Game-over" scenario.

There are several ways of getting to such a scenario:

  - Nuclear warfare
  - BioHazard weapons
  - Global-scale calamities like [Clathrate Gun Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis)

However, I started by saying that I am optimistic about the future. Hence, I sincerely hope that we start understanding the "other" side before things get that bad.
