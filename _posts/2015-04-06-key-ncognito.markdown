I wrote a small Chrome extension which allows opening links in incognito mode using the key-combination `Meta` + `Alt` with the `Click` on the link. The key combination can be changed via the settings page.

Available as a [Chrome extension in the Chrome web-store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/key-ncognito/lilomadmkegmkmkjmdbbgalimcmfogfk).

The source code is available on Github: [musically-ut/key-ncognito](https://github.com/musically-ut/key-ncognito)
