I released [@first_tmrs_only](https://twitter.com/first_tmrs_only) about [6 months ago]({% post_url 2016-01-17-first-timers-only %}).

However, I had initially used an icon I had [found online](https://freepik.com) with a plain blue banner image. Now that the bot has started getting some traction, I have decided to put a call out on [/r/logorequests](https://www.reddit.com/r/logorequests/comments/4ww9pk/twitter_bot_firsttimersonly_programming_related/) and I found a few parties interested in the task. Some of the responses, understandably, requested money for the task. However, I had to turn them down.

One of the messages was by [Issac Mikel](http://mikel.design/), who was excited about helping out. 
In a few days, he created a nice banner image:

and the icon for the bot:

Now, I am using those for on the [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/first_tmrs_only)!
