[Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/first-timers-only-78281ea47455#.e1z71cjox) way back in August 2015 about one way of getting 
more people involved in programming: by explicitly identifying issues to which
they can contributed. 

One can do that for Mozilla related bugs on [bugs ahoy!](http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/)
There is also [up-for-grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/) using which one can search for issues one can contribute to. See [www.firsttimersonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) for a comprehensive list of resources related to it.


Kenn suggested that people who want to encourage people to start contributing
to open source should include the label `first-timers-only` on some of the
easy issues which should be attempted only by people for whom it would be their
first pull request.

However, there is no explicit way of keeping a watch out on millions of projects on Github. 

Enter [@first_tmrs_only](https://twitter.com/first_tmrs_only).

Inspired by this movement, I have written a tweet-bot which checks Github for
issues with this label and tweets out a link along with the title of the
issue. This, hopefully, will help in advertising such issues.
