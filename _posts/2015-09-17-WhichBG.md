## Problem

I like to keep mixing up my background images [every half an hour or so](http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/15/change-the-desktop-wallpaper-automatically-in-mac-os-x/).
Additionally, I have about 1,500 wallpapers in my `Pictures` folder on my Mac:

{% highlight bash %}
musically_ut@Schiaparelli ~/Pictures
> $ ls | wc -l
    1523
{% endhighlight %}

*Most* of these are hand curated, but some are from wallpaper dumps I found online (e.g. from [r/wallpapers](https://reddit.com/r/wallpapers)). *Some* of these don't suit my taste or are mildly inappropriate. I would like to get rid of those images.

Though Mac allows you to [change the desktop every X minutes](http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/15/change-the-desktop-wallpaper-automatically-in-mac-os-x/), it does not provide
an easy way of mapping back a wallpaper to the file it was from.

I got quite [annoyed by this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30954492/how-to-get-the-path-to-the-current-workspace-screens-wallpaper-on-osx), and created this small app to _fix_ the
problem for myself.

## Solution

Enter WhichBG.

It is a small Mac app I wrote which should show you the currently active
wallpapers (for all the monitors). It does that by reading an `sqlite` file
where OSX (Yosemite+) saves the currently active wallpapers.

## Usage

It sits there demurely in your status bar as an icon until clicked. Upon
clicking, it generates a scrollable list of all active wallpapers:

<p align="center">
<img alt="Sits in the status bar" src="http://i.imgur.com/BUGiBMR.png" width="50%" align="center" />
</p>

When you find the wallpaper you would like to locate on your disk, you can
double click it and it'll open it in a Finder window:

<p align="center">
<img alt="Double clicking a wallpaper will open it in the Finder" src="http://i.imgur.com/x8Xlnwd.png" width="70%" align="center" />
</p>

Upon subsequent clicks, it'll re-use the same Finder window, if open.
