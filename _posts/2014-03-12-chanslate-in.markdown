I made a thing. It is called [Chanslate](http://chanslate.in).

It helps you learn a langauge while not bothering your friends too much.

While trying to talk to someone in a language you are trying to learn, it can get tiring to keep switching context between learning the language and actually communicating your ideas.

I had this problem while trying to learn German with a friend. So I created a Chanslate where you can chat in the language of your choice and it'll be translated to the other languages.

It is free to use and is open source. You can find the code on Github at [musically-ut/chanslate](https://github.com/musically-ut/chanslate).

Give it a go and tell [@musically_ut](https://twitter.com/musically_ut) how it can be improved or, alternatively, [open issues on Github](https://github.com/musically-ut/chanslate/issues?state=open).

Have fun!
