title: 'Technology Readiness Level (TRL)'

From the [Horizon 2020 - Work Programme 2016-17: General Annex](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-ga_en.pdf):


> Where a topic description refers to a TRL, the following definitions apply, unless otherwise specified:

 - `TRL 1` – basic principles observed
 - `TRL 2` – technology concept formulated
 - `TRL 3` – experimental proof of concept
 - `TRL 4` – technology validated in lab
 - `TRL 5` – technology validated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
 - `TRL 6` – technology demonstrated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies)
 - `TRL 7` – system prototype demonstration in operational environment
 - `TRL 8` – system complete and qualified
 - `TRL 9` – actual system proven in operational environment (competitive manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies; or in space)

Found from [an answer about pointless academic research on StackExchange network](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/94924/what-good-is-engineering-research-with-no-practical-relevance). 
I agree with the answer that academic research should bring an idea from TRL 1 to TRL 4-6. 
Then startups should take the idea from TRL 4-5 to TRL 7-8.
Competition should pop up at about TRL 9.
