Sometimes on Github, projects are abandoned by the original authors but the development continues on a fork. However, the original repository is often not updated to inform the new-comers. I have many times wasted effort on making a pull-request or installing old buggy versions of projects when the community had already moved to a fork.

To make matters worse, the old projects usually have higher search-engine traffic and a lot more stars than the forks. This makes the forks even harder to find. This extension tries to remedy that by adding a subscript under the name of the repository on the Github page of all projects with a link to the most notable fork (i.e. the fork with the most stars), if such a fork exists.
