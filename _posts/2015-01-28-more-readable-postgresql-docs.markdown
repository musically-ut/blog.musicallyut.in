The default way the PostgreSQL docs are shown are with the style `width: 90%`. I think it that is too wide to read comfortably on large monitors. Hence, I wrote a small [user style](https://userstyles.org/styles/109544/make-postgressql-doc-width-readable) to make it more readable.

All the style does is that it restricts the width of the documentation container: `max-width: 768px;`.
