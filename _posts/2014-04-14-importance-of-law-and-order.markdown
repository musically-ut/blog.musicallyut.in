I was recently drawn into a debate about governance and someone raised the point that law and order is only one spoke of the wheel of services which the government should provide.

I beg to differ.

I don't know where I came across this, but:

> As soon as the people who create value get to keep the money they make, the role of the government is over.

In other words, as soon as people find it _safe_ and _profitable_ to _create value_, these people will take care of all other indices of development and prosperity.

I suspect that all other duties of the government are ancillary and exist either because of inefficiencies or because we do not understand humans well enough to craft good laws.

**Update (21 April, 2014):** After some discussion with the economists [Madhav and Shreyes](http://programming-r-pro-bro.blogspot.in/), I came to realise that this idea resonates best with the [Classical economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics) which was promoted by Adam Smith in _Wealth of Nations_.

However, that idea has been now replaced by [neoclassical economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics). Here, the government is tasked with maintaining law and order _and_ building infrastructure which yields returns over a _very long term_, i.e. decades. Such infrastructure includes building roads and education. The assumption is that the entrepreneurs will not be altruistic and have enough foresight to invest in progress in such areas.
