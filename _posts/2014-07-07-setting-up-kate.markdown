I just set up [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) for my pet side-project [Chanslate](https://github.com/musically-ut/chanslate) so that other people wishing to contribute have an easy time.

It took me only a few minutes and it is delightfully easy to use.

### Make a _project_

I [just dropped](https://github.com/musically-ut/chanslate/commit/f393234877403b9ee017e8de1f04b2d9d3def08b) a `.kateproject` file in the root folder with the following content:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "Chanslate",
  "files": [ { "git": 1 } ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

And we were good to go.

You can use [_svn_ or _hg_ too](http://kate-editor.org/2012/11/02/using-the-projects-plugin-in-kate/).

### Setting up Kate

Open the settings: _Settings menu_ â†’ _Configure Kate_.

Then I set up the following:

#### `git` can change files while editing

### Optional goodies
