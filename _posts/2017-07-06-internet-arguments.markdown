# Arguments on the Internet

It is usually a foregone conclusion that arguments on the Internet head nowhere and only make matters worse.

[![Left-Right divide in the blogosphere](/content/images/2017/Jul/left-right.png)](http://allthingsgraphed.com/2014/10/09/visualizing-political-polarization/)

There is no dearth of evidence of this fact:

 - [Blog-map (the picture shown above) is divided between left-right](http://www.ramb.ethz.ch/CDstore/www2005-ws/workshop/wf10/AdamicGlanceBlogWWW.pdf)
 - [This Video will make you angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc)
 - [Echo chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media))

Recently, in [WSDM 2017](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2017/), best student paper award went to [a paper](https://gvrkiran.github.io/balancingViews/) which proposed a way of bringing the warring groups a little together.

Despite this, I still am optimistic about the future.

# Light at the end of the tunnel

My hypothesis is based on an observation which is surprising enough to have an [xkcd comics](https://xkcd.com/1414/) dedicated to it.

Quoting from it:

> Imagine kids start playing catch _all the time_. Everywhere they go, they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, and hurl them at trees and signs - nearly every waking hour of their lives. 
> Do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learned sloppy skills?

Think about the question for a moment.

The key idea in the comic is that more exposure to English language, even if it is not perfect (_e.g._ texting, SMSes, etc.), is going to make a positive difference for the people using English at the *pro* level (_i.e._, in this case the students writing the standardized exams).

The same way, I expect that as people become more aware and start to have an opinion rather than living in a small community where they do not even have to think about certain issues, the better the _pro_ opinion-havers of the generations (_read:_ the politicians) will become.

# Caveat

The danger, of course, is that we may not start improving quickly enough: perhaps the _short-term_ escalation would be sufficient to put us beyond the threshold where we end up in a *Game-over* scenario.

There are several ways of getting to such a scenario:

  - Nuclear warfare
  - BioHazard weapons
  - Global-scale calamities like [Clathrate Gun Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis)

However, I started by saying that I am optimistic about the future. Hence, I sincerely hope that we start understanding the _other_ side before things get that bad. And maybe, just maybe, [the problem is not that bad](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01616.x/abstract)?
