In a recent [conversation with Sam Harris](https://youtu.be/lOvbEmufGwY?t=1967), Jack Dorsey said that they are trying to measure the health of conversations using the following metrics:

  - **Shared attention:** what percentage of the conversation is "about" the same thing versus about dispersed.

  - **Shared reality:** what percentage of the conversation is sharing the same "facts" (irrespective of whether they agree with them or not)

  - **Receptivity:** How 'toxic' is the conversation right now? How likely are people to _walk away_ from the conversation?

  - **Variety of perspective:** How diverse are the ideas being discussed.


All of these look like interesting problems to study.
