Don't you dislike it when an author says:

> Would you like to see some of my favourite colours? Here are three: #fed82f, #37deff, #fc222f. Arenâ€™t they lovely?

Of course [the author](http://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2014_03_17_objective_next) was trying to make a point here about how our experience with computers is limited. 

_Just show me the colors_ bridges the gap a little bit. Come back with the [bookmarklet](http://musically-ut.github.io/just-show-me-the-colors/) can see the colors come to life.

Or, alternatively, press this button: <button class="" id="just-show-me-the-colors">Just show me the colors</button>

<script src="http://musically-ut.github.io/just-show-me-the-colors/just-show-me-the-colors.js"></script>
<script>
document.getElementById('just-show-me-the-colors').onclick = function (ev) { justShowMeTheColors(); };
</script>
